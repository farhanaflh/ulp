# [404 Location finder] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Farhan]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Farhan] - [St.josephs college, devagiri]

### Project Description
[404 Location Finder is a parody web app that ‚Äúhelps‚Äù users find places, objects, or destinations that don‚Äôt exist‚Äîor,
more frustratingly, can never be found. Enter any location (real or nonsense), and get poetic but utterly useless directions,
random maps, and ‚Äú404‚Äù certificates for your fruitless quest.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Too often, people know exactly where they are going. What about the valiant souls who long to be perpetually lost?
Navigating to nowhere is a tragically underserved market.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created an app to ensure you‚Äôll never find what you‚Äôre looking for. By generating random, absurd, and whimsical directions (using AI),
we guarantee adventure and existential confusion. Lost your lunchbox? Need to find Atlantis? We‚Äôll show you the way‚Äîjust follow the singing
badgers past the waterfall of second chances!]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [JavaScript, HTML, CSS]
- [None (vanilla JS for ease & parody flavor)]
- [Gemini API (for generating poetic nonsense),
-  SVG.js (for fake maps), Howler.js (for audio guides)]
- [VS Code, Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Canva (for badges/certificates)]

For Hardware:
- [None required‚Äîthe only hardware required is your sense of directions!]
### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/TheWanderingNulls/404-location-finder.git

open index.html

# Or with Live Server (VS Code extension):
# right-click index.html, select "Open with Live Server"

# Or if using a minimal Express server:
npm start
